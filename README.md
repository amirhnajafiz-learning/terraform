## TypeScript

TypeScript extends JavaScript and improves the developer experience. 
It enables developers to add type safety to their projects. 
Moreover, TypeScript provides various other features, like interfaces, type aliases, abstract classes, 
function overloading, tuple, generics, etc.

Angular is a development platform, built on TypeScript. As a platform, Angular includes:

- A component-based framework for building scalable web applications.
- A collection of well-integrated libraries that cover a wide variety of features, 
including routing, forms management, client-server communication, and more.
- A suite of developer tools to help you develop, build, test, and update your code.
